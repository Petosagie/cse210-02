# Hilo
Life is not a matter of holding good cards,
but sometimes, playing a poor hand well.

- Jack London -

Hilo is a game in which the player guesses if the next card drawn by the dealer will be higher or lower than the previous one. Points are won or lost based on whether or not the player guessed correctly.

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer installed and running on your machine. Open a terminal and 
browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.
```
python3 Hilo
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the 
project folder. Select the main module inside the Cse210-02 folder and click the "run" button.

## Project Structure
---
The project files and folders are organized as follows:
```
root                     (project root folder)
+-- director             (source code for game)
  +-- cards              (specific classes)
  +-- __main__.py        (program entry point)
+-- README.md            (general info)
```
